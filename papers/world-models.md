### [PhysiFormer: Learning to Simulate Mechanics in World Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27364v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27364v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Yiming Chen, Yushi Lan, Andrea Vedaldi

We present PhysiFormer, a diffusion transformer for physically-plausible 3D object motion. Unlike video world models that operate in view-dependent pixel space, PhysiFormer represents objects as 3D meshes expressed in world coordinates. Given the initial vertex positions and velocities, as well as object material type, rigid or elastic, the model samples future vertex trajectories. While related neural physics approaches build on ad-hoc latent spaces or explicitly enforce rigidity and causality, PhysiFormer shows that excellent results can be obtained without any such inductive biases, by…

### [Hallucination in World Models is Predictable and Preventable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27326v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27326v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Nicklas Hansen, Xiaolong Wang

Modern generative world models render increasingly realistic action-controllable futures, yet they frequently hallucinate: rollouts remain visually fluent while drifting from the ground-truth dynamics. We hypothesize that hallucination concentrates in low-coverage regions of the state-action space, where lightweight data-centric signals can both detect it and guide mitigation. To test this, we introduce MMBench2, a 427-hour, 210-task dataset for visual world modeling with ground-truth actions, rewards, and live simulators, and train a 350M-parameter world model on it. We identify three…

### [Not All Actions Are Equal: Rethinking Conditioning for Dexterous World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27325v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27325v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Zizhao Yuan, Zhengtu Liang, Taowen Wang, Qiwei Liang, Yichi Wang, Yunheng Wang et al.

Recent advances in action-conditioned world models show promising progress in modeling complex interactions and forecasting future states under diverse action sequences. While these models are often driven by stronger visual representations and model capacity, action conditioning itself remains underexplored. Most existing approaches compress the entire action sequence into a single representation, which works well for low-DoF control but becomes less reliable in high-DoF scenarios. We observe that high-DoF dexterous actions are inherently heterogeneous, spanning multiple orders of magnitude,…

### [EO-WM: A Physically Informed World Model for Probabilistic Earth Observation Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27277v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27277v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Junwei Luo, Shuai Yuan, Zhenya Yang, Yansheng Li, Zhe Liu, Hengshuang Zhao

Earth Observation (EO) forecasting aims to predict future Earth surface dynamics from satellite observations under changing meteorological conditions. In this paper, we view this task as a partially observed, weather-driven world modeling problem, in which weather acts as a conditioning signal, while forecasting remains uncertain due to sparse observations and unobserved land-surface states. However, existing methods do not fully capture this setting: deterministic models collapse uncertainty into a single future prediction, while diffusion-based methods typically treat weather variables as…

### [A Generalization Theory for JEPA-Based World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.27014v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.27014v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Jingyi Cui, Qi Zhang, Hongwei Wen, Yisen Wang

Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for world modeling by learning predictive dynamics in a latent space rather than generating future observations at the input level. Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of JEPA-based world models remains limited. In this paper, we develop the first generalization theory for JEPA-based world models. We formulate JEPA pretraining as a conditional spectral graph learning problem and show that the JEPA objective is equivalent to a low-rank factorization of an action-conditioned…

### [Einstein World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26969v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.26969v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Munachiso Samuel Nwadike, Zangir Iklassov, Ali Mekky, Zayd M. Kawakibi Zuhri, Kentaro Inui

Does intelligence require the ability to reason about phenomena beyond direct experience? It is natural to suspect that some complex thought cannot be captured through language alone. However, of particular concern to this work, is whether visualising counterfactual events can complement language as a mechanism for complex thought. We ask whether LLMs can be trained to utilise such visualisation mechanisms, in a way that benefits their reasoning abilities. Motivated by this question, we propose Einstein World Models. EWMs are a blueprint for LLM-based reasoning systems that place…

### [Look-Before-Move: Narrative-Grounded World Visual Attention in Dynamic 3D Story Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26964v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.26964v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Jiaming Bian, Bingliang Li, Yuehao Wu, Pichao Wang, Zhi Wang, Hailan Ma et al.

As embodied AI and world models increasingly operate in dynamic 3D environments, visual perception must move beyond passively interpreting given observations toward actively deciding what to observe. We study this problem through camera planning in dynamic 3D story worlds, where the camera must not only generate smooth motion, but also decide what visual evidence should be acquired before it moves. We formulate this capability as Narrative-Grounded World Visual Attention, where the camera acts as an embodied observer that determines what to observe, how to compose the observation, and how to…

### [Risk-Aware Selective Multimodal Driver Monitoring with Driver-State World Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26922v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.26922v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Daosheng Qiu, Haozhuang Chi, Hao Su, Shu Long, Xinyue Miao, Yongle Dong et al.

Continuous driver monitoring in automated vehicles requires low-latency inference while avoiding unsafe decisions under uncertain driver states. Large vision-language models provide broad multimodal priors, but their latency and limited reliability in this setting make them unsuitable as always-on in-cabin monitors. We propose a cost-aware selective inference framework for deployable multimodal driver monitoring. The core system is a lightweight RGB-physiological student that combines in-cabin visual observations with window-level HR/EDA signals, and a learned gate that decides when to accept…

### [LithoDreamer: A Physics-Informed World Model for Multi-Stage Computational Lithography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26713v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.26713v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-25
- **作者**: Yuqi Jiang, Yumeng Liu, Zimu Li, Jinyuan Deng, Qian Jin, Yucheng Cui et al.

As semiconductor technology nodes scale, computational lithography is essential for ensuring yield and performance. However, lithography is a continuous physical process involving mask optimization, optical imaging, resist exposure, and development, which existing models fail to capture. To overcome this limitation, we present LithoDreamer, the first physics-informed World Model (WM) framework for computational lithography, which formulates the ``Layout-Mask-Resist Image-After Development Image (ADI)'' pipeline as a decision-driven multi-step evolution system. LithoDreamer captures feature…

### [PhysEditWorld: A Large-Scale Dataset Toward Physics-Editable World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26694v1)

- **作者**: Bin Hu, Yanwen Ma, Jiehui Huang, Ziliang Zhang, Haoning Wu, Ruicheng Zhang et al.

Recent game world models can synthesize visually plausible, action-conditioned rollouts. However, their interaction behaviors often remain limited to exploratory or wandering trajectories, and physical dynamics are typically learned as implicit correlations from data rather than as controllable variables. This limitation hinders their applicability to authored game environments, where physical rules are deliberately designed and require explicit manipulation. We introduce PhysEditWorld, a multimodal dataset with physical parameters, with a primary focus on gravity in this initial version. At…

### [Neural Voxel Dynamics: Learning Implicit 3D Physics via Volumetric Feature Advection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26410v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.26410v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-24
- **作者**: Zican Wang, Niloy Mitra

We present a self-supervised framework for learning implicit 3D physical dynamics directly from video-derived supervisory signals. While current generative video models achieve high visual fidelity, they lack a 3D geometric foundation, often resulting in physical inconsistencies and a failure to maintain object permanence. We address this by shifting the predictive bottleneck from 2D image space to a `lifted' 3D Volumetric Latent Space. Our method unprojects semantic features from a Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) into a voxelized grid, grounded by monocular depth…

### [KRVF: A Source-Aware Semantic Voxel World Representation for Edge Mobile Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26321v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.26321v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-24
- **作者**: Runfeng Ling

Mobile manipulators need world models that are current, queryable, semantically meaningful, and usable under edge-compute constraints. This technical report presents KRVF, a source-aware semantic voxel world representation for edge mobile manipulation. Unlike reconstruction-centric mapping pipelines that primarily optimize global geometric fidelity, KRVF represents local world state as task-oriented voxels that encode occupancy, color, semantic evidence, temporal freshness, and evidence source. The representation separates measured occupancy from semantic-prior hypotheses, enabling…

### [Fast LeWorldModel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26217v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.26217v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-24
- **作者**: Yuntian Gao, Xiangyu Xu

Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), including recent LeWorldModel (LeWM), have become a promising foundation for reconstruction-free visual world models. For visual planning, however, LeWM evaluates candidate action sequences by repeatedly applying a local one-step latent transition model. This autoregressive rollout makes planning computationally expensive and exposes the predicted trajectory to accumulated latent errors as the horizon grows. We propose Fast LeWorldModel (Fast-LeWM), a fast latent world model that replaces repeated local rollout with action-prefix prediction.…

### [The Unfireable Safety Kernel: Execution-Time AI Alignment for AI Agents and Other Escapable AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26057v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.26057v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-24
- **作者**: Seth Dobrin, Łukasz Chmiel

AI agents are granted access to tools, APIs, and other infrastructure, making them active principals in those systems. The dominant approach places controls inside the agent's own runtime: system prompts, output filters, and guardrail libraries. Any control in the agent's address space is reachable by inputs that influence it; this generalizes to any AI system with sufficient reach into its own runtime, a class we term escapable AI systems. We identify four properties that an authorization mechanism must satisfy for architectural control rather than for cooperative requests: process…

### [In-Context World Modeling for Robotic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.26025v2)

- **arXiv**: `2606.26025v2`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-24
- **作者**: Siyin Wang, Junhao Shi, Senyu Fei, Zhaoyang Fu, Li Ji, Jingjing Gong et al.

Modern Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often fail to generalize to novel setups, such as altered camera viewpoints or robot morphologies, because they are typically conditioned only on current observations and language instructions. By ignoring the underlying system configuration as a variable, these models implicitly assume a fixed execution context encountered during training, necessitating data-intensive fine-tuning for any new environment. In this work, we introduce In-Context World Modeling (ICWM), a framework that treats system identification as an in-context adaptation problem.…

### [USS: Unified Spatial-Semantic Prompts for Embodied Visual Tracking with Latent Dynamics Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.25880v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.25880v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-24
- **作者**: Yuchen Xie, Xinyu Zhou, Kuangji Zuo, Yanshuo Lu, Fengrui Huang, Boyu Ma et al.

Embodied Visual Tracking (EVT) requires an agent to continuously follow a specified target while actively moving through dynamic environments. However, prevailing EVT paradigms predominantly rely on language-based target indication. While language is expressive and convenient, cluttered scenes often contain multiple objects that satisfy the same semantic description, leading to ambiguous target grounding. We therefore propose a paradigm shift, reframing target indication in EVT from text-only specification to unified spatial-semantic prompting. Based on this paradigm, we introduce Unified…

### [Beyond One-Size-Fits-All: Diagnosis-Driven Online Reinforcement Learning with Offline Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.25527v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.25527v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-24
- **作者**: Guozheng Ma, Lu Li, Zilin Wang, Pierre-Luc Bacon, Dacheng Tao

Online reinforcement learning (RL) agents increasingly depend on knowledge acquired offline to achieve practical efficiency. Originally studied in offline-to-online RL, this paradigm now spans foundation model post-training and embodied intelligence, with prior types expanding from offline datasets and pre-trained policies to increasingly diverse knowledge sources such as multimodal foundation models and generative world models. Offline priors have become central to how deep RL is developed and deployed. However, this reliance introduces a challenge that the prevailing benchmark-driven…

### [Causal-rCM: A Unified Teacher-Forcing and Self-Forcing Open Recipe for Autoregressive Diffusion Distillation in Streaming Video Generation and Interactive World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.25473v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.25473v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-24
- **作者**: Kaiwen Zheng, Guande He, Min Zhao, Jintao Zhang, Huayu Chen, Jianfei Chen et al.

Autoregressive video diffusion with causal diffusion transformers has emerged as a major paradigm for real-time streaming video generation and action-conditioned interactive world models. In this work, we extend rCM, an advanced diffusion distillation framework, to autoregressive video diffusion. The core philosophy of rCM lies in the complementarity between forward and reverse divergences, represented by consistency models (CMs) and distribution matching distillation (DMD), respectively, in diffusion distillation. This philosophy naturally carries over to the autoregressive setting, where…

### [Hypergraph Normal World Models for Logical Visual Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.25368v1)

- **arXiv**: `2606.25368v1`  |  **提交日期**: 2026-06-24
- **作者**: Weizhi Nie, Zibo Xu, Weijie Wang, Yuting Su

Visual anomaly detection is often deployed with only normal training images. Most one-class detectors map test patches or features to a normal reference distribution. This works well for local structural defects. Logical anomalies are different. Each visible part may look normal, while the whole image violates a normal count, co-occurrence, or spatial relation. This paper studies whether a model can learn such a category-specific normal world from nominal images alone. We propose the Hypergraph Normal World Model, a normal-only detector that distills frozen DINOv2 patch tokens into patch,…
